# GeoDash Editor

GeoDash Editor is the front-end code for editing [GeoDash](http://geodash.io/) dashboards and is used in most implementing projects.  In the code, it is sometimes referred to plainly as "geodasheditor".  Implementing projects use this as a dependency in their [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build pipeline; as such, there is no direct distributable from this repo.
